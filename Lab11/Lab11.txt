Documentation changes for homework1 , homework2 and homework3

Homework1: Calculator app
add comment to the method Subtraction , multiplication, division  and additrion 
Otherwise, I already commented my xml.
I had already commented much of MainActivity; even so, I turned function header comments into proper javadoc comments.
I also fixed a logic error. For selecting operators, if no operators exist, the operator will now be an empty string
	instead of an index error (fix location: onNothingSelected)

Updated comments to xml layout and menu; labeled UI elements.

Added javadoc to all functions of all 6 Java classes in homework2
Ran android's auto-formatting, too.
